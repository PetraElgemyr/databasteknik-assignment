# Database design
This assignment had focus on database normalization rules. I had to have at least 15 entities and got to learn how do divide data according to the normalization rules. The front end part was not a priority and was not graded. The main goal was to learn how to create a good database design according to SOLID. It should be easy to scale up and add functionality and the code should be structured in multiple projects, class libraries and a presentation layer.
